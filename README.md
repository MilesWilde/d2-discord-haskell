# D2 Discord Bot

D2 Discord Bot is a project created to help me practice functional programming practices while working on something I (and hopefully many others (eventually)) will find fun. Additionally started with Typescript, but will be made with a Haskell backend.

-   D2 Discord Bot will be a text-based idle-game version of the ARPG Diablo 2
-   Users will send commands to the discord bot, like \quest, \run 5 pits, and then the bot will wait the appropriate amount of time, and then send a message back with updates of the success of the trip and the items found
-   Users will be able to equip items or allocate stats and skills, and these will have influence over how quickly or successfully trips/runs will be
